## Printing Notes
Finer layer heights will result in a smoother race surface. Retraction settings can also be important to minimize blobs or lumps from perimeter starts and stops. A quick sanding also helps smooth out natural irregularities in the printed surface.

## Assembly Notes
Align the circular cuts on the inner and outer races to insert the first balls. Distribute the balls evenly around the races to hold everything in place as you continue to add more. 

## Application Notes
The flanged ball bearing can be used to join two sections together without needing additional bearing retention components.
