## Printing Notes
The circular profile of the insides of the bearings races make contact with the ball over a larger area. This increases load capacity of the bearing but adds friction because not all the points on the ball roll at the same speed. This also leads to a generally tighter fit than the standard ball bearing, so consider increasing clearances by a bit (I added 0.1mm) compared with your settings for the ball bearing.

## Assembly
Align the gaps in the races and add balls one at a time. To prevent balls from falling out, use a narrow tool to space the balls out around the race and hold the inner and outer races together while the rest of the balls are added. Leave a about one ball's worth of gap so that the balls are not squeezed against their neighbors, since this also increases friction.
